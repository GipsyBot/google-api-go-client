# google-api-go-client

This repository is meant to do batch request to the google apis since the official repo doesn't support it. 
See https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-go-client/issues/396 

Also, this issue references another package but this package is deprecated (see https://github.com/jfcote87/google-api-go-client/issues/1) so this repo was forked from https://github.com/kurtschwarz/google-api-go-client/commit/c8f5d627c7af60b481f83a7be47c10929a95d581
